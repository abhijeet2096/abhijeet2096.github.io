Hello amigos, long time no see ;) From past few months I was trying to put up a new blog, as I lost my old blog in a server crash (and No I hadn't made any backup :/).

Anyhow due to [covid-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), I finally had some time to finish this thing up. This time I was interested in setting up my blogs using static blog generators, given the ease of use of Markdown, it really makes an ideal choice. I looked into [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but finally decided to go with **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)**. Thanks to its wonderful documentation and ease-of-use, I was able to set it up and running in few hours of hacking.
